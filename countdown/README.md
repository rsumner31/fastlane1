###### Get started with fastlane development the fast way

Get in contact with the developers on Twitter: [@FastlaneTools](https://twitter.com/FastlaneTools)

<h5 align="center"><code>countdown</code> is part of <a href="https://fastlane.tools">fastlane</a>: connect all deployment tools into one streamlined workflow.</h5>

# Getting started

Make sure you have `bundler` installed using `gem install bundler`

Clone the `countdown` repo

```
git clone https://github.com/fastlane/countdown
```

Clone all `fastlane` repos and install development dependencies

```
cd countdown
[sudo] rake bootstrap
```

If you don't use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io/) you might need to run `sudo rake bootstrap` to not run into a permission error.

Before working on something, make sure to have pulled the latest changes. To pull the changes of all repos, go to the `countdown` directory and run

```
rake pull
```

# Developing

When working on something, directly edit the Ruby files in the project folders. Make sure to switch to 2 spaces in your text editor.

To run the modified version of the tool, run the following in the project directory

```
./bin/[tool_name]
```

# Debugging

I personally use a plain Sublime Text with a terminal. Debugging is pretty easy, just insert the following code to where you want to jump in:

```ruby
require 'pry'
binding.pry
```

You then jump into an interactive debugger that allows you to print out variables, call methods and much more. Continue running the original script using `control` + `d`

# Interacting with the user

You'll see some old code still using `puts` or `Helper.log.info` to print out values. From now, please only use the new `UI` class to interact with the user (both input and output)

```ruby
UI.message "Neutral message (usually white)"
UI.success "Succesully finished processing (usually green)"
UI.error "Wahaha, what's going on here! (usually red)"
UI.important "Make sure to use Windows (usually yellow)"

UI.header "Inputs" # a big box

name = UI.input("What's your name? ")
if UI.confirm("Are you '#{name}'?")
  UI.success "Oh yeah"
else
  UI.error "Wups, invalid"
end

UI.password("Your password please: ") # password inputs are hidden

# A "Dropdown" for the user
project = UI.select("Select your project: ", ["Test Project", "Test Workspace"])

UI.success("Okay #{name}, you selected '#{project}'")

# To run a command use
FastlaneCore::CommandExecutor.execute(command: "ls",
                                    print_all: true,
                                        error: proc do |error_output|
                                          # handle error here
                                        end)

# or if you just want to receive a simple value 
# use this only if the command doesn't take long
diff = Helper.backticks("git diff")

# fastlane "crash" because of a user error
# everything that is caused by the user and is not unexpected
UI.user_error!("You don't have a project in the current directory")

# an actual crash when something unexpected happened
UI.crash!("Network timeout")
```

The output will look like this

# Running tests

In the directory of one project, run the tests using

`rake test`

This will do a few things:

- Runs the tests (you can run them via `rspec` too)
- Makes sure no debug code (like `pry`) is still there
- The `--help` command works as expected

The tests are executed using `fastlane` :rocket:

To run only a subset of the tests, you can add the `now: true` keyword to the test

```ruby
it "raises an exception if it rains", now: true do
  ...
end
```

and then run these tests only using

```sh
rspec -t now
```

# Running the local code

Run your local copy using

```
./bin/[gem]
```

or install the local copy (might require `sudo`)

```
bundle install && rake install
```

# rubocop validation

The `fastlane` repos use [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) to validate the code style.

The style validation is automatically done when running `rake test`.

To automatically fix common code style issues (e.g. wrong spacing), run `rubocop -a`

To sync the latest `rubocop` rules to all repos, run `rake fetch_rubocop` in the `countdown` directory. Use `rake rubocop` to fetch the latest config and run the rubocop validation for all repos.

The configuration is always directly taken from the local `fastlane` repository..

# Submit a pull request

To submit the changes to the fastlane main repo, you have to do the following:

- Open the GitHub page of the repository you changed (e.g. [https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/gym](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/gym))
- Click on `Fork` on the top right
- On your terminal, navigate to the project you modified and run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/[my_user]/[tool_name]` (or use the `git` URL if you use private key auth)
- Squash your commits into one. For example,  to squash three commits into one, do the following: `$ git rebase -i HEAD~3`. In the text editor that comes up, replace the words "pick" with "squash" next to the commits you want to squash. Save and close the editor. For more information, take a look at [7.6 Git Tools - Rewriting History](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) 
- Run `git push upstream master`. If you pushed before squashing, go back and do the previous step, and then run `git push upstream master --force`
- Open `https://github.com/fastlane/[tool_name]` in your browser and click the green "Create Pull Request" button
